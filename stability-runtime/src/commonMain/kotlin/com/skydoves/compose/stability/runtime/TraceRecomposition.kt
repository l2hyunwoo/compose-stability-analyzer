/**
 * Annotation to enable runtime recomposition tracing for a @Composable function.
 *
 * When applied to a composable function, the compiler plugin will inject code to track:
 * - Recomposition count
 * - Parameter changes (what changed and why)
 * - Unstable parameters
 *
 * Example:
 * ```kotlin
 * @TraceRecomposition(tag = "user-profile", threshold = 3)
 * @Composable
 * fun UserProfile(user: User, onClick: () -> Unit) {
 *   // Function body
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Output in Logcat after 3rd recomposition:
 * ```
 * [Recomposition #3] UserProfile (tag: user-profile)
 *   ├─ user: User changed (User@abc → User@def)
 *   ├─ onClick: () -> Unit stable
 *   └─ Unstable parameters: [user]
 * ```
 *
 * @param tag Optional custom tag for filtering logs. Useful for grouping related composables.
 * @param threshold Only log after this many recompositions. Default is 1 (log from first recomposition).
 *               Use higher values (e.g., 5 or 10) to reduce noise in frequently recomposing screens.
